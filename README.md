## What is Laravel?

Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Some of the features of Laravel are a modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency manager, different ways for accessing relational databases, utilities that aid in application deployment and maintenance, and its orientation toward syntactic sugar.  A new term I learned, in computer science, syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer.

Laravel is regarded as one of the most popular PHP frameworks, together with Symfony, Zend, CodeIgniter, Yii2 and others.

The source code of Laravel is hosted on GitHub and licensed under the terms of MIT License.

## Benefits of Laraval

Laravel was designed to solve common development problems fast ("cost-efectively").

### Clean Documentation and MVC Support

The documentation of Laravel is clean, organised and easily understandable. Larval framework is built on 20 different libraries. Which imitates modern PHP principles and allows developers to build responsive, modular and convenient web apps. MVC pattern Architecture in larval ensures clarity between logic and presentation. This architecture helps in elaborating the performance, allows improved documentation, and has numerous built-in functions.

### Migration system for databases

Migration in laravel helps to develop the database structure of the application without re-creating it, whenever changes are made. This feature reduces the chances of losing development data. Laravel Migration provides the facility to change the structure of the database and allows the developer to use PHP code instead of SQL. Schema Builder allows us to create database tables and indices quickly. One important benefit of laravel is it helps to control databases.

### Out-of-the-box User Model

Laravel makes implementing authentication very simple. Almost everything is configured out-of-the-box. Laravel also provides a simple way to organize authorization logic and control access to resources. Having a ready-made user model let’s you get your projects up and running quickly and it’s much appreciated. It’s also nice to have the forgot password functionality there because that involves setting tokens that expire, which can be fairly complicated and time-consuming to setup. It’s cool to have this done before you even start.

### Integration with Mail Services

Laravel provides a clean, simple API over the popular SwiftMailer library. Laravel also provides drivers for SMTP, Mailgun, Mandrill, SparkPost, Amazon SES, PHP's “mail” function, and “sendmail”, allowing an application to quickly get started sending mail through a local or cloud-based service. In addition to support for sending email, Laravel provides support for sending notifications across a variety of delivery channels, including SMS (via Nexmo) and Slack.

### Unit-Testing

One of the important benefits of Laravel is it facilitates Unit testing. It runs hundreds of tests to ensure that new changes don’t unexpectedly break an application. Larval is significantly considered to be the most stable releases in the industry.

## Resources and Getting Started

### Laracasts

Laravel is supported by Laracasts, which features a mix of free and paid videos that show you how to use Laravel. The videos are all done by Jeffery Way, who is an expert and well-versed instructor. He seems to have his finger on the pulse of the essentials and offers clear and concise programming instruction. The production quality is high, and the lessons are well-thought out and meaningful.

I found the videos to be almost addicting, it's kind of like watching your favorite TV show.  I recommend starting out by following along during the first 2 intro videos that discuss installation and setting up your database, but after that I found that I learned more by just wantching the videos and will go back through and follow along later.  

### Installation

Installation instructions can be found (https://laravel.com/docs/5.5).  Just follow along step by step and you will have the default laravel App up and running in no time!
