## What is Laravel?

Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern. 

Laravel is regarded as one of the most popular PHP frameworks, together with Symfony, Zend, CodeIgniter, Yii2 and others.

The source code of Laravel is hosted on GitHub and licensed under the terms of MIT License.

## Cool Laravel Features

Laravel was designed to solve common development problems fast ("cost-efectively").

### Clean Documentation & Laracasts

Everything you need to learn Laravel can be found at [laravel.com](https://laravel.com).  

The documentation of Laravel is clean, organized and easily understandable. 

Laravel is supported by Laracasts, which features a mix of free and paid videos that show you how to use Laravel. The videos are all done by Jeffery Way. He seems to have his finger on the pulse of the essentials and offers clear and concise programming instruction. The production quality is high, and the lessons are well-thought out and meaningful.

### Easy Database Interaction

Laravel makes interacting with databases extremely simple across a variety of database backends using either raw SQL, the fluent query builder, and the Eloquent ORM. Currently, Laravel supports four databases:

MySQL
PostgreSQL
SQLite
SQL Server

Laravel's database query builder provides a convenient, fluent interface to creating and running database queries. 

In other frameworks, pagination can be very painful. Laravel's paginator is integrated with the query builder and Eloquent ORM and provides convenient, easy-to-use pagination of database results out of the box. The HTML generated by the paginator is compatible with the Bootstrap CSS framework.

Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to easily modify and share the application's database schema.

Laravel includes a simple method of seeding your database with test data using seed classes.

### Out-of-the-box User Model

Laravel makes implementing authentication very simple. Almost everything is configured out-of-the-box. Laravel also provides a simple way to organize authorization logic and control access to resources. Although it is easy to implement, it has many advanced features, such as Bcrypt hashing, checking active users, CSRF (Cross-site Request Forgery) protection, password reset, and encryption.

### Integration with Mail Services

Laravel provides a clean, simple API over the popular SwiftMailer library. Laravel also provides drivers for SMTP, Mailgun, Mandrill, SparkPost, Amazon SES, PHP's “mail” function, and “sendmail”, allowing an application to quickly get started sending mail through a local or cloud-based service. In addition to support for sending email, Laravel provides support for sending notifications across a variety of delivery channels, including SMS (via Nexmo) and Slack.

### Unit-Testing

One of the important benefits of Laravel is it facilitates Unit testing. It runs hundreds of tests to ensure that new changes don’t unexpectedly break an application. Larval is significantly considered to be the most stable releases in the industry.

### Artisan

Laravel provides built-in tool for command-line called Artisan.  Artisan can be used to create to create skelton code, database migrations, to generate basic MVC files and to perform unit tests.  

### Blade Templates

In a Laravel 5 application, you can use Blade, Laravel’s templating engine, to easily create a standard page template, or layout. That layout can then be utilized by any/all of your application’s views to give all of your pages a consistent design and structure.

The root directory of a fresh Laravel installation contains a variety of directories:

The app directory, as you might expect, contains the core code of your application. We'll explore this directory in more detail soon.

The bootstrap directory contains a few files that bootstrap the framework and configure autoloading, as well as a cache directory that contains a few framework generated files for bootstrap performance optimization.

The config directory, as the name implies, contains all of your application's configuration files.

The database directory contains your database migration and seeds. If you wish, you may also use this directory to hold an SQLite database.

The public directory contains the front controller and your assets (images, JavaScript, CSS, etc.).

The resources directory contains your views, raw assets (LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript), and localization files.

The storage directory contains compiled Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. This directory is segregated into app, framework, and  logs directories. The app directory may be used to store any files utilized by your application. The  framework directory is used to store framework generated files and caches. Finally, the logs directory contains your application's log files.

The tests directory contains your automated tests. An example PHPUnit is provided out of the box.

The vendor directory contains your Composer dependencies.
